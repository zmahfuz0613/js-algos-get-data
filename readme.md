## Mini Algorithm Exercise

"Get Data"

_Language: Javascript_

_Difficulty Rating: Medium_

### Objectives

- Given an array of objects and a string. If a recipe's ingredients include the string return the name(s) of the recipe(s). 
- The output should return an array of the recipe(s) names.

### Getting Started

- Fork and clone this repo.
- Run `bundle` from within the repo.
- Run `rspec` to make sure the tests work. (They should fail at first.)
- Get hacking on the problem, test when you think you've got it, and open a PR when it's done!

### Notes

- For e.g, if one of the ingredients in a given recipe contains Olive Oil and the string you are given is oil, then you should return the name of that recipe.

- The array should not contain the same recipe name more than once. This might happen if the same recipe contains more than one oil.
