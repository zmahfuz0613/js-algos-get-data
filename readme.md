## Mini Algorithm Exercise

"Get Data"

_Language: Javascript_

_Difficulty Rating: Medium_

### Objectives

- The function takes 2 parameters. An object of data and a string. Inside the object you will find an array of objects, which are recipes. If a recipe's ingredients contain the string, return the recipes name. 
- The output should return an array of the recipe(s) names.

#### Notes

- For e.g, if one of the ingredients in a given recipe contains Olive Oil and the string you are given is oil, then the returned array should include the name of that recipe, and any other recipes that include oil in their ingredients.
- The array should not contain the same recipe name more than once. This might happen if the same recipe contains more than one oil.

### Getting Started

- Fork and clone this repo.
